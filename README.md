# Predicting Car Prices Using Machine Learning
This project is a part of our Final Year Project (FYP), where we developed a web application to predict car prices using machine learning techniques.

# Overview
The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict car prices based on various features such as mileage, make, model, year, etc. We collected data from Kaggle and PakWheels to train our model. We utilized linear regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to build the predictive model.

# Features
- Train a machine learning model on a dataset of car features and prices.
- Deploy the trained model to a web application for predicting car prices.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for users to input car features and get predicted prices.
- Showcase the accuracy and performance of the predictive model.
# Dataset
We collected the dataset from Kaggle and PakWheels, which includes various features of cars such as mileage, make, model, year, etc., along with their corresponding prices. The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned before being used for training the machine learning model.

# Model Training
We used linear regression, a simple yet effective machine learning algorithm, to train our predictive model. The model was trained on a subset of the dataset, with features engineered and selected to optimize prediction accuracy.

# Web Application
The trained machine learning model was deployed to a web application using Flask, a Python web framework. The web app provides a user interface where users can input car features and receive predicted prices from the trained model.

# Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in requirements.txt.
3. Run the Flask application using python app.py.
4. Access the web application through your web browser.
